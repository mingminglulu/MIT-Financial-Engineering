# 1.3.1 Bibliographic remarks

: For a global view of modern corporate finance, theory and practice,
read Brealey et al. (2011), a renown textbook in business schools. For a
deeper mathematical analysis and detailed account of derivatives see
Hull (2009), Cox and Rubinstein (1985) and Neftci (2000). A more
practical view of options, their history and a long list of trading
strategies is in The Options Institute (1995). A review of the Efficient
Market Hypothesis is given by Fama (1991) and Park and Irwin (2007), and
can be complemented with the discussion on the subject found in Campbell
et al. (1997, §1.5). For an in-depth treatment of the theory of
Computational Complexity see Papadimitriou (1994). To complement the
topics treated here see Rubinstein (2006) chronological review of the
most influential research papers in the financial theory of investments.
From this source one learns, for example, the historical development of
the DCF models (Eqs. (1.17) and (1.20)) and gets the authorship record
straight: the formulas are often attributed to Gordon and Shapiro,23 but
they were first developed in 1938 by Williams in his PhD thesis
(Williams 1938). For more on the history of derivatives and asset
pricing models read Bernstein (1992Ch. 11). It is from this source where
we learned about the possibly first option contract in history (see
following note). Finally, for your bedtime reading we recommend the
financial chronicle of Paulos (2007)

# 1.3.2 Possibly the First Option Contract in History

Aristotle reports in his book of Politicsthat the Greek mathematician
and philosopher Thales the Milesian, incited by their common fellow's
belief of the inutility of his maths, set out to prove them all wrong
and worked on a financial scheme based on his knowledge of astronomy.
Reading the stars one winter, Thales was able to foresee that by the
coming year the olive harvest would be larger than usual; so he took his
savings and paid all the owners of olive presses in Chios and Miletus
for the right to use their presses in the upcoming harvest-time. He was
able to negotiate this reservation of presses at a low price since no
one could know what the harvest would be that much time ahead, and hence
no one bid against his offer. Aristotle ends this anecdote as follows:
"When the harvest-time came, and many [presses] were wanted all at once
and of a sudden, he let them out at any rate which he pleased, and made
a quantity of money. Thus he showed the world that philosophers can
easily be rich if they like, but that their ambition is of another sort"

# 1.3.3 On Short Selling

Short selling a stock is a bet for the future decrease of the price. If
the short seller is a well-known investment corporation, and since these
short positions are communicated to the public by the market
authorities, the knowledge of this news can induce the stampede from the
stock by many small investors, which would indeed knock down the price.
The European Commission has adopted a series of regulatory technical
standards on short selling that can be read at <http://ec.europa>.
eu/internal_market/securities/short_selling_en.htm. See also what the US
Securities and Exchange Commission writes about short sales at
